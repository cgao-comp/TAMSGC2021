# Running the code
## Data preprocessing
(1) In ./data, you can find the well-preprocessed sample data in pickle form. It should be mentioned that these sample data are just a small part of the complete data, you can use them to test these code. The complete data can be downloaded from https://mimic.physionet.org/

(2) In ./data, you can find our main code, and the train_model.py and the test_model.py are used to train and test our model, respectively. 

(3) In ./saved, you can find the saved model of each training epoch.
